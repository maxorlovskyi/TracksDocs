1. Within the `Parameters` section, the Tracks user can choose which Organizational Unit (Org Unit) they would like to review by clicking on the drop down and selecting the desired Organizational Unit.
   
   >Please note: By default, SLT and Corporate Tracks users will see Habit - System Wide which encompasses all Corporate and Franchisees markets and stores. DO’s by default will see only their Region and DM’s will see only their Districts.

2. **`Metric`**, by default is set to Net Sales however, contained within the **`Metric`** drop down are 16 additional metrics that can be review on the KPI Dashboard. Metrics included are: Check Count, Entrée Count, Actual Labor Hours, Actual Labor Dollars, OT/DT Hours, OT/DT Dollars, Comps, Promos, Voids, Over/Shorts, Check Average, Entrée Average, Labor Percentage, Average Labor Rate, Sales Per Labor Hour (No Zero Rate), Sale Per Labor Hour (Include Zero Rate).

3. The **`Periods to Show`** section is a way to setup what periods the user will see while viewing the KPI Dashboard. Simply click on the periods you want to see each time you view the dashboard, then click the **`Refresh`** button. Once done, that will set the periods shown going forward, an important note that if the Web Browsers cache is cleared at anytime it will clear the boxes checked in the Periods to Show section.

4. The **`Include Pre-Open`** button when checked will include pre-opening data for New Store Openings. The button when pressed will appear in green instead of blue which means that option is **`active`**.

5. The **`Values to Show`** section is where the user can choose the way the comparison data is shown on the dashboard. **`Actual Amount`** will show by default, **`Variance Amount`** will show the data plus or minus to current year data and **`Variance Percentage`** will show the percentage plus or minus to current year data.

6. Missing Data at a glance, Missing Sales, Labor or Transactional data will show in red boxes in this area to show the user if there are missing data elements in Tracks. If the user hovers the mouse pointer over a red box, a pop up will display what store or stores are missing data on each specific red box. The number shown in parentheses () is a store count for that missing data element.

7. The **`Profile`** button gives the user the ability to switch between Tracks dashboards such as the KPI or Ops Alerts dashboards.

8. The **`Business Date`** give the user the ability to switch to past business dates. With the Tracks KPI Dynamic Dashboard the comp store number and associated data will update based on the date chosen.

9. The **`Organizational Structure`** button allows the user to change between the Habit Organizational Structures based on the user’s level of access (ex. DM’s will only be able to see their District assigned to their Tracks user profile).

10. Based on the Organizational Structure and Metric chosen the data will refresh and appear in the body of the dashboard.

11. The pink highlighted area above is the Comp Section of the KPI Dynamic Dashboard which is collapsed and will always appear at the top of the dashboard. The number to the right in parentheses is the number of comps stores in that organizational structure based on the business date chosen.
