>The New schedule option is for a store that is just about to open or a Manager that would like to start a schedule from scratch instead of copying from a previous week. The most popular and efficient way to create a schedule is to copy from a previous week.


## Sales Forecasting

1. Click on the forecast amount under the day of the week you want to adjust the sales forecast for on the **`Adjusted`** row, this will bring up the **`Weekly Forecast`** window.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/weeklyforecast.jpg)

2. Enter the sales forecast in the yellow highlighted **`Manager Adjusted`** field. Once you have entered the forecast amount for that day, simply click on the next day of the week you need to adjust the forecast for at the top of the **`Weekly Forecast`** window. Be sure to click the **`Save`** button once you have completed adjusting the sales forecast.

## Adding Above Guide Hours

1. We have simplified the Above Guide process for quicker setup on a weekly basis. To add the Above Guide labels to a specific day, click on the Above Guide row directly under the day you need to add the Above Guide credits. An Above Guide Window will then pop up.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/aboveguide.jpg)

2. Locate and click on the blue plus sign **`+`** next to the Above Guide credit that needs to be added to the day.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/aboveguide2.jpg)

3. Once all the Above Guide credits are added for the desired day, simply click the **`Save`** button and move on to the next day.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/newempl.jpg)

>The Above Guide labels are now pre-populated with the Operations approved, Company Standard Above Guide hour credits. Managers will no longer have to enter a value for the each Above Guide credit they add to the schedule each week.


## Adding a Shift Week View

1. To add or edit a shift to the schedule from the Week View just click on the shift box to the right of the employee you would like to schedule or edit the employee shift. Notice we have added a blue highlight bar across the screen that shows what employee you are about to schedule.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/week.jpg)

2. After clicking the shift box or existing shift you want to schedule, an **`Edit`** shift window will pop up. From here you can **`Swap`** an employee for an existing shift or **`Add`** a new shift for an employee as well as **`Save`** your edits when done. Just click the option you want at the bottom of the **`Edit`** window.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/edit.jpg)

>If you click on an existing shift, you will see that shift populate in the **`Edit`** window. When you click on the Swap button, employees that are not schedule for that day, within a specific job code, will populate on the employee menu that shows after the **`Swap`** button is clicked on.

3. To add a new shift, click the **`Add Shift`** button. A shift will populate on the screen for you to choose the In and Out time. The date will automatically populate for the day you are scheduling. You can now either type in the shift In and Out time using either regular time 12 Hour or military time 24 Hour or just choose from the drop down by clicking on the Clock Face icon to the right of the AM/PM   ![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/clock.jpg)

## Adding a Shift Day View

1. There are two ways in the **`Day`** view to add a new shift to the schedule. The first is to click on the start time of the shift, while holding down the mouse button, drag the mouse cursor across the time bar at the top of the screen to the Out time of the desired shift.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/dailylaborinfo.jpg)

2. After the desired shift has been assigned by dragging from the In time to the Out time a window will pop up. On the **`Select Job Code`** window, click on the job code of the employee you are scheduling.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/selectjobcode.jpg)

3. After clicking on the job code, a **`Choose Employees`** window will pop up. Click on the employee you would like to fill the new shift you just created. The employees available that have not been schedule for that day will be listed in black lettering. After you select the employee, click on the **`+ Set Sub Shift`** button to finish creating the shift. Important to note, if you have two or more employees that will be working the same shift within that job code, you are now able to click on those employees and schedule them at the same time.

4. You will be taken to the **`Set Sub Shift`** window where you can review the shift you created, make any edits (if needed) then click the **`Save`** button.

>If there is a conflict with the shift In/Out time or shift In/Out Date Tracks will show an invalid error message in the Validation column.


1. The second way to add a New shift to the **`Day`** view is to click on the **`+ Employees`** button on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.

![labormanagment](/assets/labormanagment/addempl.jpg)

2. This will bring up the same **`Select Job Code`** window as the Click and Drag across the Time Bar method. Simply repeat steps 2 through 4 (as first way to add a New shift) to add a new shift using the employee.

## Adding a Split Shift

1. Managers can now schedule a spilt shift in the Tracks version. While adding a new shift for an employee that will be working a split shift, set the In and Out time for the first shift. Then click on the **`Add Shift`** button at the bottom of the window.

>California Stores must schedule at least one (1) hour in between split shifts.


## Navigation Bar

1. The Navigation Bar in the Tracks has been updated and is now located at the bottom of the screen. The Navigation Bar has relevant functionality and features unique to each of Tracks modules the stores works in on a daily basis. The new Navigation Bar for the Labor Management module is explained below, working from left to right.

## Addition of Undo and Redo Buttons

1. In the Tracks we have introduced Undo and Redo buttons in the Labor Management module, located in the top left hand corner of the Tracks Labor screen. Once a change is made the Undo and Redo buttons will appear. You can then Undo that change or Redo a pervious undone change by clicking the appropriate Icon.
